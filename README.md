Arduino sketch to bridge a USB MIDI interface to a remote transmitter which switches a red ```Recording``` light.

A simple Ableton [control surface](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/206240184-Creating-your-own-Control-Surface-script) to track the state of the ```record```button and send out MIDI CC values to the switch. There are two alternative versions of the control surface, a system version in python, and a user version which is a simple text file.

Any remote transmitter with dry contact input should work.  The products in the picture are [ITS-2000](https://www.intertechno.at/product-page/its-2000-funk-twinsender) and [ITWR-3500](https://www.intertechno.at/product-page/itwr-3500-funk-powerschalter).
